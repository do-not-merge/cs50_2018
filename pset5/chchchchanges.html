            I feel like everything is "known" about the United States at this point. Were I to move to another state, I would know the language, societal expectations, and could reckon the type of places
            I'd frequent after a week or two. This predictability is painful. I'm bored. From moving around a lot to settling in a spot in your 20s seems to be...a waste, no? Maybe it's my youth getting the better of me, but 
            as many here choose to forget: <i>there is a world out there.</i> It has the most beautiful, awful, stupid, brilliant people and places. It's a gem. <br><br>
            What better way to veture out there more than moving to the far East? I've always enjoyed learning morsels of the East Asian tongues (currently
            learning Korean!) and have picked up English and Spanish from formal education and interaction with the people I've met along the way. I've been lucky in that sense. Learning by experiencing a new culture would be dope too.
            I know I've seen a little bit more of this globe than the average Joe (no offense to Joe) and I'm super grateful for these experiences. I'd assume that I could pursue an advanced degree abroad and try to 
            adapt quickly by traveling off the beaten path? Maybe the only thing holding me back is...letting go? Damn. To be continued...
