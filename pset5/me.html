        I didn't cry when I was born in Brazil. I was just quiet. And I remained like this for years...maybe it was due to moving to and fro, from the States to Brazil and back again. Maybe it was silence that rendered
        comfort from the uncertainties of change, the latter the only constant I knew until late in middle school; we would move from one place to the next every 1 to 3 years before that. Brazil. The States. Houston. Brazil. 
        Ohio. NYC. Miami. California. If it were not for divine providence at the last hour (well, this for the young teen me as I would've grown a lot from that experience in hindsight) my sister and I would be going to an American 
        school in Beijing or Singapore. But alas, here we are. And now I'm looking to live in Asia for a change of...well, everything. Funny that. My mom recently told me that when I was 6 years old, we had to write something 
        we'd like to do when we were bigger. I wrote (or so she claims) that I would "travel the world and learn everyone's cultures and languages". She then told me I was adopted. The last part was a joke. My humor.
