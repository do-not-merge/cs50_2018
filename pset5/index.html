              <h1>The Beginning</h1>
              <p>Established in 1995, this legend initially grew up in Brazil. Once his father decided that pursuing middle-class ambitions in metropolitan S&#227;o Paolo was not enough to make
                 a poignant, indie documentary worthy of an Oscar he decided to move to the U.S. with his wife,—this at a time where most Americans he met thought all Brazilians 
                 were models who spoke Spanish and played football. He realized only one of those things wasn't true.<br><br> Hooked?

              <p>Ah, fuuuck. <i>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"</i> It's always the question I'm asked—response tentatively given, borne out of wishful thinking or, at times, pure fantasy.

              <h1>What is Up</h1>
              <p>Guilherme currently lives in Silicon Valley: Home of Tech Bro Idealism, Data Mining, and Gentrification.&#8482; While he enjoys the thought of living here and works on pretty cool stuff, he isn't too stoked about the idea of staying here
                for too long because like...it like totally lacks things L.A. offered. And what other global cities did too. Sigh. Seriously, I could go on about all the pros and cons about California's booming tech hub and the effects it's having on the 
                community due to its rapid growth...

              <h1>CEC@UCLA</h1>
              <p>In the true spirit of Hollywood, I got involved in the entertainment industry through the Campus Events Commission in college.<br>
              <br>Think "live entertainment providers for students": free concerts featuring local (and international) artists; 
                  celebrity (or niche) speaker panels, and movie studios working with us to show movies to Bruins before they came out. 
              <p>It was neat leading the Speakers team and #networking with talent managers and their clients. And, true to form, I left all that behind for the engineering industry. I'm quite the wanderer, yes.</p>

              <p>This guy is currently working on satellite components for Lockheed Martin. The work is cool, but not sure this is exactly where I fit. 
                 I don't even understand me at times.</p>
